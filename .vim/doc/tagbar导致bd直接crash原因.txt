Bug重现:

Bug reproduce:
Start vim,
      open a file for which tagbar can generate tags,
      ToggleTagbar.
      Switch the main window to a different buffer.

      The tagbar remains active. If the different buffer is taggable, the TagBar will be updated, otherwise the TagBar will retain the tags of the previous buffer.

      Now, delete the buffer you switched to, which is now the current buffer:
      :bd[elete]

      Vim will crash.

      //如果在关闭(禁止)tagbar之前,做:bd的操作,vim不会退出
      If you deactivate the TagBar before you delete the buffer, no crash.

details:
Vim isn't crashing here.
What's happening is this: when you delete a buffer Vim will close the window associated with it (unless it's the last one), and if Tagbar notices that it is the last window open it will quit Vim (since a Tagbar window without any other windows is pretty useless).
I'm not sure what the best solution would be for this problem: there's no way to keep Vim from closing the window without creating a function like this one, and keeping the Tagbar window open as the only window is also not very useful.
So I guess the best workaround would be to either not use :bdelete or use a function like the one I linked.

解决方案:
映射<leader>d 为关闭buffer,关闭前,先调用:TagbarClose<cr>关闭tagbar窗口
